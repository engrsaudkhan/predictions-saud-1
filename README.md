This Graphical User Interface for Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Graphical User Interface (GUI) for compressive strength prediction of metakaolin-based cement mortars developed by **

I have made the GUI public for the usage and improvement of more similar problems and the sole purpose of research and development.

** Muhammad Saud Khan from Department of Civil Engineering, University of Manitoba, Canada, and Department of Civil Engineering, COMSATS University Islamabad and Department of Civil Engineering, and Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology with the contribution of:

1) Zohaib Mehmood from Department of Computer Science, COMSATS University Islamabad, and 
2) Waleed Bin Inqiad from Department of Structural Engineering, National University of Sciences and Technology.

Here are some tips how we have developed the GUI.
1) Python must be installed.
2) relevant libraries must be installed including, for user ease import following libraries
-------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------

2) Run it in IDEs such as VS code, Jupyter notebook, Anaconda, Spyder, etc.
3) Load code*.

* Make sure to change directory 

Tips to run code.
1) Install all libraries
2) Make sure all files uploaded here are contained in relevant folder
3) Just run the code.
4) Using scroll adjust input values
5) Click on predict under model (click on relevant property to be predicted)
6) See output
9) Change values and repeat the process from 2 to 6
